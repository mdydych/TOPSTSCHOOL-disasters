    "text": "In this lesson, we will analyze the 2023 Yellowknife wildfire evacuation using multiple satellite-derived datasets to assess evacuation route vulnerability and regional smoke impacts. You will learn how to access and process data from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 18 (GOES-18) satellite, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Burned Area Product.\nThe analysis integrates active fire detections, smoke plumes, wind patterns, and infrastructure data to understand the complex conditions that led to the evacuation of approximately 20,000 residents. Through hands-on analysis, you will work with both near real-time data and post-processed remotely-sensed satellite products. The integration of these datasets shows how emergency managers can use publicly-available data to support evacuation decisions and understand hazard conditions.\nThis lesson emphasizes practical applications of remote sensing data for emergency management, while also exploring the strengths and limitations of different satellite products. By analyzing the Yellowknife evacuation, you will gain experience with workflows that can be applied to other wildfire events and natural hazards.\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface: A Note on Data Interpretation and Emergency Management\n\n\n\nThis lesson uses real data from an evacuation that impacted thousands of residents. While we focus on technical analysis, it’s important to remember that wildfire evacuation decisions involve many factors beyond what can be captured in satellite data. The workflows demonstrated here are meant to complement, not replace, the expertise of emergency managers, fire behavior specialists, and local authorities.\nThe integration of multiple data sources can provide valuable insights, but satellite data has limitations: - Cloud cover can obstruct observations - Temporal and spatial resolution may miss important changes - Data latency may affect real-time decision making - Local conditions may differ from satellite-based measurements\nAlways consider these limitations when using remote sensing data to support emergency management decisions."

    "section": "Wildfires and the 2023 Season",
    "text": "Wildfires and the 2023 Season\nWildfires are a natural and essential component of North American forest ecosystems, particularly in the boreal forests that stretch across Canada (Girardin, Ali, and Hély 2010; Johnson, Miyanishi, and Bridge 2001; Zackrisson, Nilsson, and Wardle 1996). These fires play a crucial role in maintaining forest health, recycling nutrients, and promoting biodiversity (Running 2006). However, climate change has begun to alter historical fire regimes, leading to more frequent, intense, and extensive wildfires that pose increasing challenges to both ecosystems and human communities (Mora et al. 2018; Pausas and Keeley 2021; Jones et al. 2024).\nIn Canada’s boreal forests, fire has historically occurred in natural cycles ranging from 50 to 200 years, helping to maintain a mosaic of forest ages and compositions. Indigenous peoples have long understood and managed these fire regimes, using controlled burns as a land management tool (Christianson 2014; Lewis 1978; W. Wang et al. 2022). Today, changing climate conditions are disrupting these traditional patterns. Longer fire seasons, increased lightning activity, and more severe drought conditions are creating unprecedented fire behavior and risk scenarios.\n2\nThe human impacts of these changing fire regimes are particularly acute in Canada’s northern communities, where limited road networks often leave few evacuation options. Additionally, smoke from these fires can affect air quality across vast regions, creating public health challenges even for communities far from the actual flames (Jones et al. 2024). The economic implications are also significant, affecting industries from tourism to mining, and straining emergency response resources.\nThe 2023 wildfire season emerged as a stark illustration of these evolving challenges. The Northwest Territories experienced one of its most devastating fire seasons on record, characterized by record-breaking temperatures and severe drought conditions (Jones et al. 2024). The season saw over 236 fires that burned approximately 4 million hectares of land, over twice the previous record in Canada and over seven times the annual average, forcing the first complete evacuation of Yellowknife in its history. The scale of displacement was unprecedented, with an estimated 70% of Northwest Territories residents forced to leave their homes (Ridgen 2024). Critical infrastructure, including communities, mines, and transportation networks, faced significant threats, highlighting the vulnerability of northern communities to extreme fire events.\nThese events showcased both the immediate and long-term challenges of managing wildfires in a changing climate, while also demonstrating the critical importance of robust monitoring and early warning systems. The season served as a powerful example of why enhanced understanding of fire behavior and improved prediction capabilities are essential for protecting communities and ecosystems in an increasingly fire-prone world.\n3\nThe Northwest Territories (NWT) encompasses a vast expanse of northern Canada, covering approximately 1.14 million square kilometers of diverse terrain dominated by boreal forest ecosystems. This region represents one of Canada’s most fire-prone areas, where the interplay of climate, vegetation, and geography creates conditions conducive to regular fire activity. The landscape is fundamentally shaped by the Canadian Shield, an ancient bedrock formation characterized by exposed Precambrian rock, countless lakes, and wetlands that create a complex mosaic of fire-susceptible and fire-resistant terrain.\n\nYellowknife\n4\nAt the heart of this region lies Yellowknife, the territorial capital, situated on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake. With approximately 20,000 residents, it serves as the primary urban center and economic hub of the NWT (City of Yellowknife 2025). The city’s boreal forest setting is dominated by black spruce and jack pine, species that have evolved with fire and even depend on it for regeneration. Black spruce, in particular, has adapted to release its seeds from sealed cones when exposed to the intense heat of forest fires, while jack pine stands often require fire to maintain their ecological dominance.\nThe region experiences a subarctic climate, characterized by long, cold winters where temperatures regularly drop below -30°C, and short, warm summers with extended daylight hours. This climate regime creates a distinct fire season that, historically, has been concentrated in the brief summer months. However, climate change is increasingly extending this fire season at both ends, creating new challenges for fire management and community safety (Pausas and Keeley 2021; Running 2006).\nInfrastructure in the NWT is notably limited, with Yellowknife connected to southern Canada by a single highway (Highway 3) and air travel serving as a crucial transportation link. This isolation is even more pronounced for the numerous remote communities scattered throughout the territory, many of which are accessible only by air or seasonal ice roads. This limited transportation network creates particular challenges for emergency management and evacuation scenarios during severe fire events, as demonstrated during recent fire seasons.\n\n\nThe 2023 Yellowknife Wildfire Crisis\n5\nThe summer of 2023 brought unprecedented wildfire activity to the Northwest Territories, culminating in the evacuation of Yellowknife in mid-August. The immediate threat came from the Behchokǫ̀ wildfire (designated ZF015-23 (MNP 2024)), which began southwest of Yellowknife and rapidly expanded under extreme fire weather conditions. By August 15th, the fire had grown to over 167,000 hectares and was advancing approximately 1.2 kilometers per hour toward the territorial capital (Northwest Territories 2024).\n6\nOn August 16th, territorial officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for all 20,000 Yellowknife residents, marking the largest evacuation in NWT history (Graveland 2023). The evacuation presented significant logistical challenges due to limited egress routes. Highway 3, the only road connecting Yellowknife to southern Canada, became a critical lifeline with evacuees forming long convoys south toward Alberta. Meanwhile, military and civilian aircraft conducted one of the largest air evacuations in Canadian history, prioritizing elderly residents, those with medical needs, and individuals without personal vehicles (Lindeman 2023).\nThe fire’s behavior was particularly concerning due to the extreme conditions: temperatures reaching 30°C, relative humidity below 30%, and strong, erratic winds gusting over 40 km/h. These conditions, combined with the region’s unusually dry summer, created what fire behavior specialists termed “crown fire conditions” - where fires spread rapidly through the upper canopy of the forest (X. Wang et al. 2024). By August 17th, the fire had reached within 15 kilometers of Yellowknife’s city limits.\nEmergency response efforts focused on establishing protective measures around the city, including fire breaks and sprinkler systems. Fire crews, supported by the Canadian military, worked to protect critical infrastructure including the airport, power plants, and communications facilities. The nearby communities of Dettah and Ndilǫ also faced evacuation orders, highlighting the fire’s broad regional impact.\nThe evacuation order remained in effect for 21 days, with residents unable to return until September 6th. This extended displacement period had significant social and economic impacts on the community, while also demonstrating the challenges of protecting isolated northern communities from wildfire threats. The event served as a stark reminder of the increasing vulnerability of northern communities to extreme fire events in a changing climate.\n\n\nWildfire and Climate Change\nThe unprecedented scale and intensity of the 2023 NWT fire season exemplifies the broader impacts of climate change on northern fire regimes. Canada’s Arctic regions are warming at approximately three times the global average rate, fundamentally altering the conditions that have historically governed wildfire behavior (Environment and Canada 2023). This accelerated warming is creating longer fire seasons, with snow melting earlier in spring and winter arriving later in fall, extending the period during which fires can ignite and spread (Climate Change (IPCC) 2023). The warming trend is particularly pronounced in the Northwest Territories, where average temperatures have increased by 2.3°C since 1948, compared to a 1.1°C increase globally.\nThese changing conditions are challenging traditional approaches to fire management and community protection. Historical fire behavior models, based on decades of past observations, are becoming less reliable as new climate patterns emerge. Fire intensity is increasing due to drier fuels and more frequent extreme weather events, while fire spread patterns are becoming more erratic and less predictable. For northern communities like Yellowknife, these changes represent an existential challenge: traditional fire breaks may prove insufficient, evacuation routes may become more frequently threatened, and the resources required for fire suppression may exceed historical requirements. The 2023 evacuation of Yellowknife serves as a harbinger of the complex challenges that northern communities face in adapting to this new reality of fire risk in a warming climate.\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis in Emergency Response and Resource Management\nModern wildfire management increasingly relies on geospatial analysis and remote sensing technologies to support critical decision-making. Natural resource managers and emergency response teams leverage multiple satellite platforms, weather data, and spatial analysis techniques to monitor fire progression, assess risks, and coordinate response efforts in near-real-time. During the Yellowknife evacuation, these tools proved instrumental in tracking the Behchokǫ̀ wildfire’s progression, predicting its behavior, and making informed evacuation decisions.\nThe integration of multiple data sources - from active fire detections to smoke forecasts - allows emergency managers to develop a comprehensive understanding of evolving fire situations. NASA’s FIRMS provides near-real-time fire locations, while GOES satellites track smoke plume development and movement. When combined with infrastructure data and analyzed through modern spatial techniques, these datasets enable rapid assessment of threats to communities, critical infrastructure, and evacuation routes. Post-fire, these same tools support damage assessment and recovery planning through the analysis of burn severity and infrastructure impacts.\nThe Yellowknife wildfire crisis of 2023 serves as an ideal case study for demonstrating these analytical approaches. In the following analysis, we will explore how different remote sensing products can be integrated to monitor and assess wildfire impacts, particularly in northern communities where traditional ground-based monitoring may be limited. We will demonstrate techniques for processing and analyzing multiple satellite data streams, assessing infrastructure vulnerability, and quantifying fire impacts - the same types of analyses that support real-world emergency response and resource management decisions. This practical application of geospatial analysis techniques provides valuable insights into both the technical methods and their critical role in modern fire management."

The City of Yellowknife provides municipal boundary data through their open data portal. We’ll use this boundary as our primary study area and create buffered zones for different aspects of our analysis.\nFirst, let’s set up our data directory and download the boundary file:\n\n# Create a data directory if it doesn't exist\nif (!dir.exists(\"data\")) {\n  dir.create(\"data\")\n}\n\n# Download Yellowknife municipal boundary\nboundary_url &lt;- \"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/5959bad3315946c0827f85d8cdeb3b8c_0/downloads/data?format=shp&spatialRefId=26911&where=1%3D1\"\n\n# Perform GET request with httr\nres &lt;- httr::GET(\n  url = boundary_url,\n  httr::write_disk(\"data/yellowknife_boundary.zip\", overwrite = TRUE),\n  httr::config(followlocation = TRUE),\n  httr::verbose()\n)\n\n\nres\n\nResponse [https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/5959bad3315946c0827f85d8cdeb3b8c_0/downloads/data?format=shp&spatialRefId=26911&where=1%3D1]\n  Date: 2025-04-11 19:47\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/zip\n  Size: 2.59 kB\n&lt;ON DISK&gt;  F:\\TOPSSCHOOL\\git\\TOPSTSCHOOL-disasters\\data\\yellowknife_boundary.zip\n\n\nNext, we’ll unzip the downloaded file and read the municipal boundary layer. The data comes in a geodatabase format and is already in UTM Zone 11N (EPSG:26911):\n\n# Unzip the file\nutils::unzip(\"data/yellowknife_boundary.zip\", \n             exdir = \"data/yellowknife_boundaries\")\n\n\n# Read the municipal boundary layer\nyk_boundary &lt;- sf::st_read(\n  \"data/yellowknife_boundaries/Municipal_Boundary.shp\"\n) |&gt; \n  identity()\n\nReading layer `Municipal_Boundary' from data source \n  `F:\\TOPSSCHOOL\\git\\TOPSTSCHOOL-disasters\\data\\yellowknife_boundaries\\Municipal_Boundary.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 4 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 627843.7 ymin: 6922154 xmax: 639196 ymax: 6937449\nProjected CRS: NAD83 / UTM zone 11N\n\n\nLet’s examine the structure of our boundary object to ensure we have the data we need:\n\n# Examine the structure of the boundary object\nutils::str(yk_boundary)\n\nClasses 'sf' and 'data.frame':  1 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ OBJECTID  : int 2\n $ Shape__Are: num 1.37e+08\n $ Shape__Len: num 52067\n $ GlobalID  : chr \"{4686254D-0548-4E65-A506-388EA2A1414E}\"\n $ geometry  :sfc_POLYGON of length 1; first list element: List of 1\n  ..$ : num [1:11, 1:2] 627844 632135 631950 638805 639196 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"POLYGON\" \"sfg\"\n - attr(*, \"sf_column\")= chr \"geometry\"\n - attr(*, \"agr\")= Factor w/ 3 levels \"constant\",\"aggregate\",..: NA NA NA NA\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"OBJECTID\" \"Shape__Are\" \"Shape__Len\" \"GlobalID\"\n\n\nFinally, we’ll create a basic map of our study area using ggplot2. This will help us verify that we’ve properly loaded the boundary data:\n\n# Create a basic map of our study area\nggplot2::ggplot() +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = yk_boundary, \n                   fill = \"lightblue\", \n                   color = \"black\") +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Yellowknife Municipal Boundary\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"Municipal Area: \", \n                     round(sf::st_area(yk_boundary)/1000000, 2), \n                     \" sq km\"),\n    caption = \"Data source: City of Yellowknife Open Data Portal\"\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::coord_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boundary will serve as our primary reference for analyzing the wildfire impacts around Yellowknife. Throughout our analysis, we’ll create different buffer zones around this boundary to capture various aspects of the fire event, such as: - A 50km buffer for analyzing local fire detections - A 500km buffer for analyzing smoke plume dispersion - Custom buffers for specific analyses of evacuation routes and infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science Review\n\n\n\nWhen working with spatial data it’s important to understand a few key concepts:\n\nCoordinate Reference Systems (CRS): Different spatial datasets might use different coordinate systems. The Yellowknife boundary data comes in UTM Zone 11N (EPSG:26911), which is appropriate for this region of Canada.\nSpatial Objects in R: We’re using the sf (Simple Features) package, which is the modern standard for handling vector spatial data in R. The sf package integrates well with the tidyverse and provides efficient tools for spatial operations.\nData Formats: Spatial data comes in many formats. Here we’re working with a geodatabase (.gdb), but you might also encounter shapefiles (.shp), GeoJSON, and other formats. The sf package can handle most common spatial data formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Detection\nSatellite-based fire detection has transformed our ability to monitor and respond to wildfires, particularly in remote regions like Canada’s Northwest Territories. These systems use thermal anomaly detection algorithms that identify areas significantly warmer than their surroundings, enabling near real-time monitoring of fire activity across vast landscapes. When combined with ground observations and other data sources, satellite fire products provide crucial information for fire managers, emergency responders, and researchers studying fire behavior and impacts.\nSeveral major satellite systems provide operational fire detection products. NASA’s MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have been providing global fire detections at 1km resolution since 2000, making them valuable for long-term studies. The VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites offer improved detection capabilities with 375m resolution, able to detect smaller fires and provide more precise fire perimeter mapping. Geostationary satellites like GOES-16 and GOES-17 provide rapid fire detection updates every 5-15 minutes, though at coarser spatial resolution. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-3 satellites also provide global fire detection through their Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument.\nIn this analysis, we’ll focus on two complementary fire products that helped track the Yellowknife fires. The VIIRS 375m active fire product from NOAA-20, accessed through NASA’s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System), provides detailed fire detection points with associated fire radiative power measurements. We’ll combine this with the VIIRS Burned Area product (VNP64A1), which uses changes in surface reflectance to map the final extent of burned areas at 500m resolution. Together, these products allow us to analyze both the progression of active burning and the ultimate footprint of the fires.\n\nFire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)\nNASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) distributes near real-time active fire data within 3 hours of satellite observation. The system synthesizes fire detections from both MODIS and VIIRS instruments, though we’ll focus on the VIIRS 375m data from NOAA-20 for its enhanced spatial resolution. Each FIRMS record provides not just the location of detected fires, but also their intensity measured as Fire Radiative Power (FRP) in megawatts. FRP serves as a proxy for fire intensity, with higher values generally indicating more intense burning and greater fuel consumption. This combination of location, timing, and intensity data makes FIRMS an invaluable tool for tracking fire progression and identifying areas of most intense fire activity. During the Yellowknife evacuation, FIRMS data provided critical information about fire location and intensity to emergency managers and the public.\nFirst, we need to create our search area and acquire relevant basemap data.

Higher FRP values generally indicate more intense fires. The VIIRS sensor can detect:\n\nSmaller/cooler fires: ~1-10 MW\nModerate fires: ~10-100 MW\nLarge/intense fires: &gt;100 MW\n\nFRP helps fire managers assess fire intensity and potential severity, though it’s important to note that factors like cloud cover can affect detection capabilities.\n\n\nNow we can create a series of visualizations to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of fire activity. First, let’s create a map showing all fire detections colored by their intensity (FRP):\n\n# Create main static visualization\np1 &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() +\n  tidyterra::geom_spatraster_rgb(data = basemap_tiles) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = search_area, \n                   fill = NA, \n                   color = \"gray60\", \n                   linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = yk_boundary, \n                   fill = NA, \n                   color = \"#00BFFF\", \n                   linewidth = 1.2) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = firms_points,\n                   ggplot2::aes(color = frp),\n                   alpha = 0.7,\n                   size = 2) +\n  ggplot2::scale_color_gradientn(\n    colors = c(\"orange\", \"orange red\", \"red\", \"dark red\", \"purple\"),\n    name = \"Fire Radiative\\nPower (MW)\"\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Yellowknife Fire Detections\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"August 10-23, 2023\\nTotal detections:\", nrow(firms_points)),\n    caption = \"Data: VIIRS 375m from NOAA-20 satellite\"\n  )\n\nprint(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand how fire activity changed over time, we’ll create two temporal plots - one showing the number of daily detections and another showing fire intensity:\n\n# Define evacuation date\nevac_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-08-16\")\n\n# Create temporal progression plot\np2 &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(daily_stats, ggplot2::aes(x = date)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = evac_date, \n                      color = \"purple\", \n                      linetype = \"dashed\",\n                      alpha = 0.85,\n                      linewidth = 1.5) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = detections), color = \"#00BFFF\", linewidth = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(y = detections), color = \"#00BFFF\", size = 3) +\n  ggplot2::scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 day\", date_labels = \"%b %d\") +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Daily Fire Detections\",\n    subtitle = \"Purple line indicates evacuation date (Aug 16)\",\n    y = \"Number of detections\",\n    x = \"Date\"\n  )\n\nprint(p2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s examine how fire intensity changed throughout the period:\n\n# Create FRP intensity plot with proper legend\np3 &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(daily_stats, ggplot2::aes(x = date)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = evac_date, \n                        color = \"purple\", \n                        linetype = \"dashed\",\n                        alpha = 0.85,\n                        linewidth = 1.5) +\n    ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = mean_frp, color = \"Mean FRP\"), linewidth = 1) +\n    ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(y = mean_frp, color = \"Mean FRP\"), size = 3) +\n    ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = max_frp, color = \"Max FRP\"), linewidth = 1) +\n    ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(y = max_frp, color = \"Max FRP\"), size = 3) +\n     ggplot2::scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 day\", date_labels = \"%b %d\") +\n    ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n    ggplot2::labs(\n      title = \"Fire Radiative Power Over Time\",\n      subtitle = \"Purple line indicates evacuation date (Aug 16)\",\n      y = \"Fire Radiative Power (MW)\",\n      x = \"Date\"\n    ) +\n    ggplot2::scale_color_manual(\n      values = c(\"Mean FRP\" = \"#00BFFF\", \"Max FRP\" = \"#0040ff\"),\n      name = \"Metric\"\n    )\n\nprint(p3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s summarize our findings in a clear table:\n\n# Create summary statistics table using kableExtra\nstats_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\n    \"Date Range\",\n    \"Total Detections\",\n    \"Mean FRP\",\n    \"Max FRP\",\n    \"Peak Detection Date\",\n    \"Peak Daily Detections\"\n  ),\n  Value = c(\n    paste(min(firms_points$date), \"to\", max(firms_points$date)),\n    as.character(nrow(firms_points)),\n    paste(round(mean(firms_points$frp), 2), \"MW\"),\n    paste(round(max(firms_points$frp), 2), \"MW\"),\n    as.character(daily_stats$date[which.max(daily_stats$detections)]),\n    as.character(daily_stats$detections[which.max(daily_stats$detections)])\n  )\n)\n\n# Create formatted HTML table\nknitr::kable(stats_df, \n             format = \"html\",\n             caption = \"Yellowknife Fire Analysis Summary\") |&gt;\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"left\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)\n\n\nYellowknife Fire Analysis Summary\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nDate Range\n2023-08-10 to 2023-08-19\n\n\nTotal Detections\n8886\n\n\nMean FRP\n10.26 MW\n\n\nMax FRP\n1643.92 MW\n\n\nPeak Detection Date\n2023-08-15\n\n\nPeak Daily Detections\n2345\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science Review\n\n\n\nSeveral key data science concepts are demonstrated in this analysis:\n\nAPI Interaction: We use the FIRMS API to programmatically access fire detection data, demonstrating how to construct and execute API requests.\nSpatial Data Processing: The analysis shows how to:\n\nTransform between coordinate systems\nCreate spatial buffers\nJoin spatial and temporal data\n\nData Visualization Best Practices:\n\nUsing appropriate color scales for fire intensity\nIncluding reference lines for key events (evacuation date)\nProviding clear labels and legends\nCreating multi-panel visualizations for different aspects of the data\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Complex Perimeters\nWhile individual fire detections give us point-based information about fire activity, understanding the overall fire extent and progression requires analyzing these points as continuous complexes. We’ll use spatial clustering and concave hull techniques to create meaningful fire perimeters from our point detections.\nFirst, let’s create a function that will generate fire perimeters for a given date using concave hull geometry:\n\n  # Create perimeters with adjusted parameters\n\n # The concavity parameter (default = 1) controls how tightly the hull wraps around points:\n  # - Lower values (e.g., 0.5) create more detailed, tighter boundaries\n  # - Higher values (e.g., 2) create smoother, more generalized boundaries\n  # The threshold parameter sets the minimum segment length (in coordinate units)\n  # to prevent very small segments in the hull\n\ncreate_fire_perimeters &lt;- function(points,\n                                   date,\n                                   # Controls how tightly hull fits points\n                                   concavity = 1,\n                                   # Minimum segment length\n                                   threshold = 1) {\n  \n  daily_points &lt;- points |&gt;\n    dplyr::filter(date == !!date)\n  \n  if (nrow(daily_points) &lt; 3) {\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  \n  coords &lt;- sf::st_coordinates(daily_points)\n  hull &lt;- concaveman::concaveman(coords, concavity = concavity, length_threshold = threshold)\n  \n  polygon_sf &lt;- sf::st_polygon(list(hull)) |&gt;\n    sf::st_sfc(crs = sf::st_crs(points)) |&gt;\n    sf::st_sf()\n  \n  perimeter &lt;- polygon_sf |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n      date = date,\n      n_points = nrow(daily_points),\n      mean_frp = mean(daily_points$frp),\n      area_km2 = as.numeric(units::set_units(sf::st_area(polygon_sf), \"km^2\"))\n    )\n  \n  return(perimeter)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Concave Hulls\n\n\n\nA concave hull (also known as a concave closure or α-shape) provides a more realistic boundary around a set of points compared to a convex hull. While a convex hull creates the smallest convex polygon that contains all points, a concave hull can “wrap” more tightly around the points, capturing the true shape of the point distribution. This is particularly useful for fire perimeter mapping, where we want to represent the actual extent of fire activity rather than just the outer bounds.\n\n\nNext, let’s create daily perimeters for our analysis period:\n\n# Create daily perimeters\nunique_dates &lt;- unique(firms_points$date)\nfire_perimeters &lt;-\n  do.call(rbind,\n                lapply(unique_dates, function(d)\n                  create_fire_perimeters(firms_points, d, 1, 0.01)))\n\n# Find dates of maximum area and point counts\nmax_stats &lt;- list(\n  area_date = fire_perimeters |&gt;\n    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(area_km2)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::slice(1) |&gt;\n    dplyr::pull(date),\n  points_date = fire_perimeters |&gt;\n    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(n_points)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::slice(1) |&gt;\n    dplyr::pull(date)\n)\n\nHowever, single perimeters can sometimes oversimplify complex fire situations. To better represent distinct fire complexes, we’ll create a clustering function that can identify separate fire groups:\n\n  # eps (epsilon) is the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors\n  # eps = 5000 means points within 5km of each other are considered part of the same cluster\n  # This value was chosen based on:\n  # - Typical fire spread distances in boreal forests\n  # - Spatial resolution of VIIRS fire detections (375m)\n  # - Desire to identify distinct fire complexes while avoiding over-segmentation\n\ncreate_clustered_perimeters &lt;- function(points, \n                                        date,\n                                        eps = 5000) {  \n\n  #

Unlike FIRMS data which captures active burning, VNP64A1 identifies the full extent of burned areas at 500m resolution, including areas that may have burned without being detected as active fires due to cloud cover or timing of satellite overpasses. The product assigns each pixel a “burn date” indicating when the burn was first detected, allowing for temporal analysis of fire progression. This approach is particularly valuable for post-fire assessment and validation of active fire detections, though it has limitations in near real-time monitoring due to its processing latency. For the Yellowknife fires, VNP64A1 data helps us understand the total area impacted and verify the progression patterns suggested by FIRMS detections.\nThe VNP64A1 data used in this analysis was acquired through NASA’s Earthdata Cloud Search Portal (earthdata.nasa.gov/search), which allows users to search, preview, and download specific granules based on location and date range. After identifying granules covering the Yellowknife region during August 2023, the data was downloaded in HDF5 format for processing into a folder called “data”.\nFirst, let’s locate and read our VIIRS burned area files. We’ll focus on files from August 1 (day 213) to September 1 (day 244):\n\n# Get a list of VIIRS Burned Area files\nviirs_files &lt;- list.files(\n  \"data/VNP64A1.002/\",\n  pattern = \"A2023(213|244).*\\\\.hdf$\",\n  full.names = TRUE\n)\n\n# Print the files we'll be working with\nprint(\"VIIRS Burned Area files to process:\")\n\n[1] \"VIIRS Burned Area files to process:\"\n\nprint(viirs_files)\n\n[1] \"data/VNP64A1.002/VNP64A1.A2023213.h12v02.002.2023276103300.hdf\"\n[2] \"data/VNP64A1.002/VNP64A1.A2023244.h12v02.002.2023312150240.hdf\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding VIIRS Burned Area Data\n\n\n\nThe VNP64A1 product contains several data layers, but the primary “Burn Date” layer records the day of year when a burn was detected. Special values include: - 0: Unburned - -1: Unmapped - -2: Water\n\n\nNow we’ll process each HDF file, extracting the burn date information:\n\n# Create empty list to store processed burn date layers\nburn_dates_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Process each HDF file\nfor (i in seq_along(viirs_files)) {\n  # Read the HDF file using terra\n  burn_rast &lt;- terra::rast(viirs_files[i])\n  \n  # Print layer names for first file to verify structure\n  if (i == 1) {\n    print(\"\\nLayer names in the HDF file:\")\n    print(names(burn_rast))\n  }\n  \n  # Extract burn date layer (first layer)\n  burn_date &lt;- burn_rast[[1]]  # Select \"Burn Date\" layer\n  \n  # Process burn dates\n  # Convert to more meaningful values and handle special codes\n  values &lt;- terra::values(burn_date)\n  values[values &lt;= 0] &lt;- NA\n  terra::values(burn_date) &lt;- values\n  \n  # Store processed layer\n  burn_dates_list[[i]] &lt;- burn_date\n  \n  print(paste(\"Processed file\", i, \"of\", length(viirs_files)))\n}\n\n[1] \"\\nLayer names in the HDF file:\"\n[1] \"\\\"Burn Date\\\"\"             \"\\\"Burn Date Uncertainty\\\"\"\n[3] \"QA\"                        \"\\\"First Day\\\"\"            \n[5] \"\\\"Last Day\\\"\"             \n[1] \"Processed file 1 of 2\"\n[1] \"Processed file 2 of 2\"\n\n\nNext, we’ll combine our processed tiles into a single mosaic and align it with our study area:\n\n# Mosaic all tiles together in one step\nburn_mosaic &lt;- terra::mosaic(burn_dates_list[[1]], \n                             burn_dates_list[[2]], \n                            #  burn_dates_list[[3]], \n                            #  burn_dates_list[[4]], \n                             fun = \"last\")  # Use most recent valid observation\n\n# Reproject to match our other data (EPSG:4326)\nburn_mosaic_4326 &lt;- terra::project(burn_mosaic, \"EPSG:4326\")\n\n# Add a buffer to capture the full extent of the fire\nstudy_area_buffer &lt;- sf::st_buffer(yk_boundary, 50000)\n\n# Convert study area buffer to SpatVector for terra operations\nstudy_area_vect &lt;- terra::vect(study_area_buffer)\n\n# Project study area to match burn mosaic's original CRS (sinusoidal)\nstudy_area_proj &lt;- terra::project(study_area_vect, terra::crs(burn_mosaic))\n\n# Crop and mask the burn data\nburn_clipped &lt;- terra::crop(burn_mosaic, study_area_proj)\nburn_clipped &lt;- terra::mask(burn_clipped, study_area_proj)\n\n# Now project everything to EPSG:4326 for visualization\nburn_clipped_4326 &lt;- terra::project(burn_clipped, \"EPSG:4326\")\nstudy_area_4326 &lt;- terra::project(study_area_vect, \"EPSG:4326\")\nyk_boundary_4326 &lt;- terra::project(terra::vect(yk_boundary), \"EPSG:4326\")\n\nTo prepare for visualization, we’ll convert our data to a format suitable for ggplot and create meaningful time periods:\n\n# Convert raster to data frame for plotting\nburn_df &lt;- terra::as.data.frame(burn_clipped_4326, xy = TRUE)\nnames(burn_df)[3] &lt;- \"burn_date\"\n\n# Convert burn dates to actual dates\nburn_df$date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-01-01\") + burn_df$burn_date -

While several satellite products can detect smoke, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from geostationary satellites provide particularly valuable data for monitoring smoke plumes due to their high temporal frequency. AOD quantifies the degree to which aerosols (including smoke particles) prevent the transmission of light through the atmosphere, serving as a proxy for smoke density and air quality impacts.\nThe GOES-18 ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) Level 2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product provides near real-time monitoring of aerosol loading across North America at 15-minute intervals. This high temporal resolution allows for detailed tracking of smoke plume development and transport, though at a coarser spatial resolution than some polar-orbiting satellites. The product provides AOD values ranging from 0 (clear sky) to 5 (very thick aerosol), with values above 1 typically indicating significant smoke impacts. During the Yellowknife evacuation, this data helped emergency managers assess potential impacts on communities and transportation routes as smoke complicated both ground and air evacuation efforts.\nI’ll help break down the “Visualizing a Snapshot” code section into meaningful chunks with clear narrative:\n\nVisualizing a Snapshot\nLet’s begin by selecting a timestamp during peak fire activity to examine smoke conditions. We’ll focus on August 15th, the day before the evacuation order:\n\n# Pick a timestamp during peak fire activity\ntest_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-08-15\")  # Day before evacuation\ntest_hour &lt;- 18  # Mid-afternoon local time\n\nThe GOES-18 data is stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets, organized by product, year, day of year, and hour. We’ll construct the appropriate path and retrieve the file list:\n\n# Get GOES file list\ngoes_url &lt;- sprintf(\n  \"%s/%s/%s/%02d\",\n  \"ABI-L2-AODF\",\n  format(test_date, \"%Y\"),\n  format(test_date, \"%j\"),\n  test_hour\n)\n\nfiles_df &lt;- aws.s3::get_bucket_df(\n  bucket = \"noaa-goes18\",\n  prefix = goes_url,\n  region = \"us-east-1\",\n  max = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding GOES Data Organization\n\n\n\nGOES satellite data follows a consistent naming convention: - ABI-L2-AODF: Product name (Aerosol Optical Depth Full Disk) - Year/DayOfYear/Hour: Temporal organization - Multiple files per hour represent different scan times\n\n\nNow we’ll download and read the most recent file for our selected timestamp:\n\n# Get most recent file\nlatest_file &lt;- files_df |&gt;\n  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(LastModified)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::slice(1)\n\n# Download and read file\nurl &lt;- sprintf(\"https://noaa-goes18.s3.amazonaws.com/%s\", latest_file$Key)\ntemp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".nc\")\ndownload.file(url, temp_file, mode = \"wb\", quiet = TRUE)\naod_data &lt;- stars::read_stars(temp_file, sub = \"AOD\", quiet = TRUE)\nunlink(temp_file)\n\nTo focus our analysis on the Yellowknife area, we’ll create two buffer zones around the city:\n\n# Create visualization extent (100km buffer for context)\nyk_buffer_big &lt;- sf::st_buffer(yk_boundary, 100000)\nyk_buffer_small &lt;- sf::st_buffer(yk_boundary, 50000)  # 50km for analysis\n\n# Transform to GOES projection\nyk_buffer_goes &lt;- sf::st_transform(yk_buffer_big, sf::st_crs(aod_data))\nyk_small_goes &lt;- sf::st_transform(yk_buffer_small, sf::st_crs(aod_data))\n\n# Crop to our area of interest\naod_local &lt;- sf::st_crop(aod_data, yk_buffer_goes)\n\nFinally, we can create a visualization of the smoke conditions:\n\n# Create visualization\nggplot2::ggplot() +\n  stars::geom_stars(data = aod_local) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = sf::st_transform(yk_boundary, sf::st_crs(aod_data)),\n          fill = NA, color = \"#00BFFF\", linewidth = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = yk_small_goes,\n          fill = NA, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"AOD\",\n    na.value = NA,\n    option = \"inferno\",\n    limits = c(0, 3)\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"GOES-18 AOD Data Around Yellowknife\",\n    subtitle = format(test_date, \"%B %d, %Y %H:00 UTC\"),\n    caption = \"Red: City boundary\\nBlue dashed: 50km analysis buffer\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting AOD Values\n\n\n\nAerosol Optical Depth values can be roughly interpreted as: - 0.0-0.1: Clear sky - 0.1-0.3: Light haze - 0.3-0.5: Moderate haze - 0.5-1.0: Heavy haze - &gt;1.0: Very heavy smoke/haze\nHigher values indicate more particles in the atmospheric column, suggesting thicker smoke plumes and potentially worse air quality.\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Analysis of AOD Values\nTo understand how smoke conditions evolved during the evacuation period, we’ll analyze AOD values over several days. First, let’s create some helper functions to streamline our data processing:\n\n# Functions for GOES data handling\ngoes_date_format &lt;- function(date) {\n  list(\n    year = format(date, \"%Y\"),\n    doy = format(date, \"%j\")\n  )\n}\n\n# Function to construct https URL from Key\nconstruct_url &lt;- function(key, bucket = \"noaa-goes18\") {\n  sprintf(\"https://%s.s3.amazonaws.com/%s\", bucket, key)\n}\n\n# Function to get GOES files\nget_goes_files &lt;- function(date, hour, product = \"ABI-L2-AODF\", satellite = \"goes18\") {\n  # Get date components\n  date_parts &lt;- goes_date_format(date)\n  \n  # Construct prefix\n  prefix &lt;- sprintf(\n    \"%s/%s/%s/%02d/\",\n    product,\n    date_parts$year,\n    date_parts$doy,\n    hour\n  )\n  \n  message(\"Searching prefix: \", prefix, \" in \", satellite)\n  \n  # Get file list from bucket\n  files_df &lt;- aws.s3::get_bucket_df(\n    bucket = paste0(\"noaa-\", satellite),\n    prefix = prefix,\n    region = \"us-east-1\",\n    max = 20\n  )\n  \n  if (nrow(files_df) &gt; 0) {\n    files_df$LastModified &lt;- as.POSIXct(\n      files_df$LastModified,\n      format = \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z\",\n      tz = \"UTC\"\n    )\n    files_df$satellite &lt;- satellite\n  }\n  \n  return(files_df)\n}\n\nNow we’ll create a function to process AOD data for specific timestamps:\n\n# Function to get and process AOD data for a specific timestamp\nget_aod_data &lt;- function(date, hour) {\n  # Get file list\n  files_df &lt;- get_goes_files(\n    date = date,\n    hour = hour,\n    product = \"ABI-L2-AODF\",\n    satellite = \"goes18\"\n  )\n  \n  if (nrow(files_df) == 0) {\n    message(\"No files found for: \", date, \" \", hour, \":00 UTC\")\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  \n  # Get most recent file\n  latest_file &lt;- files_df |&gt;\n    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(LastModified)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::slice(1)\n  \n  # Download and read file\n  url &lt;- construct_url(latest_file$Key, bucket = \"noaa-goes18\")\n  temp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".nc\")\n  \n  utils::download.file(\n    url = url,\n    destfile = temp_file,\n    mode = \"wb\",\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n  \n  # Read AOD data\n  aod_data &lt;- stars::read_stars(\n    temp_file,\n    sub = \"AOD\",\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n  \n  # Clean up\n  unlink(temp_file)\n  \n  return(aod_data)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOES Data Processing Tips\n\n\n\nThe GOES AWS bucket provides the most recent 7 days of data at no cost. When downloading multiple files: - Use appropriate time intervals to avoid redundant data - Consider file size limitations and download times - Remember that UTC timestamps are used for data organization\n\n\nWe’ll also need a function to calculate statistics for our area of interest:\n\n# Modify calculate_local_stats function to strip units\ncalculate_local_stats &lt;- function(aod_data, local_area) {\n  # Transform and crop to local area\n  tryCatch({\n    local_goes &lt;- sf::st_transform(local_area, sf::st_crs(aod_data))\n    aod_local &lt;- sf::st_crop(aod_data, local_goes)\n    \n    # Check if we have any valid data\n    if (sum(!is.na(aod_local[[1]])) &gt; 0) {\n      # Convert to numeric to strip units\n      # GOES AOD values come with units attached (dimensionless optical depth units)\n      # We strip these for easier calculation and compatibility with other functions\n      # Raw AOD values typically range from 0-5, where:\n      # 0-0.1: Clear sky\n      # 0.1-0.3: Light haze\n      # &gt;1.0: Heavy smoke\n      values &lt;- as.numeric(aod_local[[1]])\n      # Convert to numeric to strip units\n      values &lt;- as.numeric(aod_local[[1]])\n      \n      stats &lt;- list(\n        mean_aod = mean(values, na.rm = TRUE),\n        max_aod = max(values, na.rm = TRUE),\n        valid_pixels = sum(!is.na(values)),\n        total_pixels = length(values)\n      )\n    } else {\n      stats &lt;- list(\n        mean_aod = NA_real_,\n        max_aod = NA_real_,\n        valid_pixels = 0L,\n        total_pixels = length(aod_local[[1]])\n      )\n    }\n    return(stats)\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    message(\"Error in processing: \", e$message)\n    return(list(\n      mean_aod = NA_real_,\n      max_aod = NA_real_,\n      valid_pixels = 0L,\n      total_pixels = 0L\n    ))\n  })\n}\n\nNow we can define our analysis period and process multiple timestamps:\n\n# Define analysis period (5 days before to 3 days after evacuation)\nanalysis_dates &lt;- seq(\n  as.Date(\"2023-08-11\"),  # 5 days before evacuation\n  as.Date(\"2023-08-19\"),  # 3 days after evacuation\n  by = \"day\"\n)\n\n# Define daily hours to analyze (daylight hours in UTC)\nanalysis_hours &lt;- c(16, 18, 20, 22)  # Approximately 10am-4pm local time\n\n# Create analysis timestamp combinations\nanalysis_times &lt;- expand.grid(\n  date = analysis_dates,\n  hour = analysis_hours\n)\n\n# Process data for all analysis times\naod_results &lt;- lapply(1:nrow(analysis_times), function(i) {\n  date &lt;- analysis_times$date[i]\n  hour &lt;- analysis_times$hour[i]\n  \n  message(\"\\nProcessing: \", date, \" \", hour, \":00 UTC\")\n  \n  # Get AOD data\n  aod_data &lt;- get_aod_data(date, hour)\n  \n  if (is.null(aod_data)) {\n    return(list(\n      datetime = as.POSIXct(\n        paste(date, sprintf(\"%02d:00:00\", hour)),\n        tz = \"UTC\"\n      ),\n      mean_aod = NA_real_,\n      max_aod = NA_real_,\n      valid_pixels = 0L,\n      total_pixels = 0L\n    ))\n  }\n  \n  # Calculate statistics\n  stats &lt;- calculate_local_stats(aod_data, yk_buffer_small)\n  \n  # Add timestamp\n  stats$datetime &lt;- as.POSIXct(\n    paste(date, sprintf(\"%02d:00:00\", hour)),\n    tz = \"UTC\"\n  )\n  \n  return(stats)\n})\n\n# Convert to data frame and handle NaN/Inf values\naod_df &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(aod_results) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    mean_aod = replace(mean_aod, !is.finite(mean_aod), NA),\n    max_aod = replace(max_aod, !is.finite(max_aod), NA)\n  )\n\nFor context, let’s provide a reference table for interpreting AOD values in terms of air quality provided by the World Health Organization:\n\n# Create WHO threshold reference table\nwho_thresholds &lt;- data.frame(\n  Category = c(\"Good\", \"Moderate\", \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\", \n               \"Unhealthy\", \"Very Unhealthy\", \"Hazardous\"),\n  `PM2.5 (µg/m³)` = c(\"0-12\", \"12.1-35.4\", \"35.5-55.4\", \n                      \"55.5-150.4\", \"150.5-250.4\", \"&gt;250.5\"),\n  `Approximate AOD` = c(\"&lt;0.1\", \"0.1-0.3\", \"0.3-0.5\", \n                       \"0.5-1.0\", \"1.0-2.0\", \"&gt;2.0\"),\n  check.names = FALSE\n)\n\nNow we can create visualizations to show how smoke conditions evolved. First, a time series of AOD values:\n\n# Create time series visualization with WHO thresholds\np1 &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() +\n  # Add WHO threshold reference lines\n  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"yellow\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = 1.0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"orange\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = 2.0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Add evacuation reference line\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(\n    xintercept = as.POSIXct(\"2023-08-16 00:00:00\", tz = \"UTC\"),\n    color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  # Add AOD lines\n  ggplot2::geom_line(data = aod_df, \n                     ggplot2::aes(x = datetime, y = mean_aod, color = \"Mean AOD\")) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(data = aod_df,\n                      ggplot2::aes(x = datetime, y = mean_aod, color = \"Mean AOD\")) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(data = aod_df,\n                     ggplot2::aes(x = datetime, y = max_aod, color = \"Max AOD\")) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(data = aod_df,\n                      ggplot2::aes(x = datetime, y = max_aod, color = \"Max AOD\")) +\n  # Customize appearance\n  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"Metric\",\n    values = c(\"Mean AOD\" = \"blue\", \"Max AOD\" = \"red\")\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Aerosol Optical Depth Around Yellowknife\",\n    subtitle = \"50km radius, GOES-18 observations\",\n    x = \"Date/Time (UTC)\",\n    y = \"Aerosol Optical Depth\",\n    caption = \"Red dashed vertical line: Evacuation date\\nHorizontal lines: WHO thresholds (yellow=unhealthy, orange=very unhealthy, red=hazardous)\"\n  )\n\nprint(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s summarize our findings:\n\n# Create summary statistics table\nvalid_coverage &lt;- aod_df |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(total_pixels &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(\n    coverage = mean(valid_pixels/total_pixels * 100, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(coverage)\n\nstats_table &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Analysis Period\", \"Mean AOD\", \"Maximum AOD\", \"Average Valid Coverage\"),\n  Value = c(\n    paste(format(min(aod_df$datetime), \"%B %d %H:%M UTC\"), \"to\",\n          format(max(aod_df$datetime), \"%B %d %H:%M UTC\")),\n    sprintf(\"%.3f\", mean(aod_df$mean_aod, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    sprintf(\"%.3f\", max(aod_df$max_aod, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", valid_coverage)\n  )\n)\n\n# Display tables\nknitr::kable(stats_table,\n             caption = \"AOD Analysis Summary Statistics\")\n\n\nAOD Analysis Summary Statistics\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Period\nAugust 11 16:00 UTC to August 19 22:00 UTC\n\n\nMean AOD\n0.751\n\n\nMaximum AOD\n4.997\n\n\nAverage Valid Coverage\n17.0%\n\n\n\n\nknitr::kable(who_thresholds,\n             caption = \"WHO Air Quality Categories and Approximate AOD Values\")\n\n\nWHO Air Quality Categories and Approximate AOD Values\n\n\nCategory\nPM2.5 (µg/m³)\nApproximate AOD\n\n\n\n\nGood\n0-12\n&lt;0.1\n\n\nModerate\n12.1-35.4\n0.1-0.3\n\n\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups\n35.5-55.4\n0.3-0.5\n\n\nUnhealthy\n55.5-150.4\n0.5-1.0\n\n\nVery Unhealthy\n150.5-250.4\n1.0-2.0\n\n\nHazardous\n&gt;250.5\n&gt;2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Temporal AOD Patterns\n\n\n\nWhen interpreting temporal AOD patterns, consider: 1. Diurnal cycles - smoke often settles overnight and lifts during the day 2. Wind patterns - can cause rapid changes in local smoke conditions 3. Cloud interference - can cause gaps in the data 4. Vertical distribution - AOD measures the entire column, not just surface conditions\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Maximum Plume Spread\nTo understand the full spatial extent of smoke impacts, we’ll analyze a larger area around Yellowknife during peak smoke conditions. First, let’s create a function to process plume data for specific timestamps:\n\n# Function to process plume data for a specific timestamp\nanalyze_plume &lt;- function(date, hour, plume_buffer) {\n  # Get GOES file\n  files_df &lt;- get_goes_files(\n    date = date,\n    hour = hour,\n    product = \"ABI-L2-AODF\",\n    satellite = \"goes18\"\n  )\n  \n  if (nrow(files_df) == 0) {\n    message(\"No files found for: \", date, \" \", hour, \":00 UTC\")\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  \n  # Get most recent file for timestamp\n  latest_file &lt;- files_df |&gt;\n    dplyr::arrange(desc(LastModified)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::slice(1)\n  \n  # Download and read data\n  url &lt;- construct_url(latest_file$Key, bucket = \"noaa-goes18\")\n  temp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".nc\")\n  utils::download.file(url, temp_file, mode = \"wb\", quiet = TRUE)\n  aod_data &lt;- stars::read_stars(temp_file, sub = \"AOD\", quiet = TRUE)\n  unlink(temp_file)\n  \n  # Transform and crop to plume analysis extent\n  plume_goes &lt;- sf::st_transform(plume_buffer, sf::st_crs(aod_data))\n  plume_aod &lt;- sf::st_crop(aod_data, plume_goes)\n  \n  # Calculate plume statistics\n  values &lt;- as.numeric(plume_aod[[1]])\n  stats &lt;- list(\n    datetime = as.POSIXct(\n      paste(date, sprintf(\"%02d:00:00\", hour)),\n      tz = \"UTC\"\n    ),\n    mean_aod = mean(values, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_aod = max(values, na.rm = TRUE),\n    heavy_smoke_area = sum(values &gt;

1 (significant visibility reduction) - Heavy smoke: AOD &gt; 2 (severe air quality impacts)\nThe area calculation (0.0081 km² per pixel) is based on the GOES-R ABI resolution at nadir.\n\n\nNow let’s analyze a focused period around the evacuation:\n\n# Define analysis period (3 days centered on evacuation)\nanalysis_dates &lt;- seq(\n  as.Date(\"2023-08-15\"),  # Day before evacuation\n  as.Date(\"2023-08-17\"),  # Day after evacuation\n  by = \"day\"\n)\n\n# Define daily hours to analyze (focusing on peak hours)\nanalysis_hours &lt;- c(16, 18, 20, 22)  # ~10am-4pm local time\n\n# Create timestamp combinations\nanalysis_times &lt;- expand.grid(\n  date = analysis_dates,\n  hour = analysis_hours\n)\n\n# Define larger analysis extent (500km radius for plume tracking)\nplume_buffer &lt;- sf::st_buffer(yk_boundary, 500000)  # 500km\n\n# Process all timestamps\nplume_results &lt;- lapply(1:nrow(analysis_times), function(i) {\n  date &lt;- analysis_times$date[i]\n  hour &lt;- analysis_times$hour[i]\n  \n  message(\"\\nProcessing: \", date, \" \", hour, \":00 UTC\")\n  analyze_plume(date, hour, plume_buffer)\n})\n\nLet’s extract statistics and create a time series of plume extent:\n\n# Extract statistics into data frame\nplume_stats &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(lapply(plume_results, function(x) {\n  if (!is.null(x)) {\n    data.frame(\n      datetime = x$datetime,\n      mean_aod = x$mean_aod,\n      max_aod = x$max_aod,\n      heavy_smoke_area = x$heavy_smoke_area,\n      moderate_smoke_area = x$moderate_smoke_area\n    )\n  }\n}))\n\n# Create time series visualization of plume metrics\np1_plume &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(plume_stats) +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(\n    xintercept = as.POSIXct(\"2023-08-16 00:00:00\", tz = \"UTC\"),\n    color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(x = datetime, y = moderate_smoke_area, \n                                  color = \"Moderate Smoke (AOD &gt;

Consider both intensity (AOD values) and spatial coverage 2. Remember that AOD measures total column aerosol - smoke may be at various heights 3. Cloud cover can create gaps in the data 4. The 500km analysis radius helps capture regional-scale impacts\n\n\n\n\n\nGOES-18 Wind Patterns\nUnderstanding atmospheric transport is crucial for predicting smoke impacts during wildfire events. Wind patterns not only influence fire behavior but also determine how smoke will affect surrounding communities. During the Yellowknife evacuation, wind conditions played a dual role: affecting both fire progression and creating hazardous air quality conditions that complicated evacuation efforts.\nTraditionally, smoke transport has been monitored through a combination of ground-based weather stations and atmospheric models. However, these methods can have significant limitations in remote regions like the Northwest Territories, where weather stations are sparse and model validation data is limited. Satellite-derived wind products help fill these gaps by providing broad spatial coverage and frequent updates. The GOES-18 Derived Motion Winds (DMW) product is particularly valuable as it provides wind measurements at multiple atmospheric levels by tracking the movement of features (such as clouds and water vapor) in successive satellite images.\nFor our analysis, we’ll focus on winds during the period of peak smoke intensity, combining GOES-18 DMW data with our aerosol optical depth measurements. This integration helps us understand: 1. The atmospheric conditions that influenced smoke transport 2. Potential evacuation routes that may have been impacted 3. Areas where convergent winds may have concentrated smoke 4. The broader regional transport patterns that affected air quality across the Northwest Territories\nFirst, let’s create a function to retrieve and process wind data.\n\n# Function to get wind data for a specific timestamp\nget_wind_data &lt;- function(date, hour) {\n  # Get DMW (Derived Motion Winds) file\n  files_df &lt;- get_goes_files(\n    date = date,\n    hour = hour,\n    product = \"ABI-L2-DMWVF\",  # Full disk product\n    satellite = \"goes18\"\n  )\n  \n  if (nrow(files_df) == 0) {\n    message(\"No wind files found for: \", date, \" \", hour, \":00 UTC\")\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  \n  # Get most recent file\n  latest_file &lt;- files_df |&gt;\n    dplyr::arrange(desc(LastModified)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::slice(1)\n  \n  # Download and read data\n  url &lt;- construct_url(latest_file$Key, bucket = \"noaa-goes18\")\n  temp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".nc\")\n  utils::download.file(url, temp_file, mode = \"wb\", quiet = TRUE)\n  \n  # Read with ncdf4\n  nc &lt;- ncdf4::nc_open(temp_file)\n  \n  # Read wind data\n  tryCatch({\n    wind_data &lt;- list(\n      speed = ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc, \"wind_speed\"),\n      direction = ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc, \"wind_direction\"),\n      lat = ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc, \"lat\"),\n      lon = ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc, \"lon\"),\n      quality = ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc, \"DQF\")  # Quality flag\n    )\n    \n    # Create data frame of valid winds (where quality == 0)\n    valid_idx &lt;- which(wind_data$quality == 0)\n    wind_df &lt;- data.frame(\n      longitude = wind_data$lon[valid_idx],\n      latitude = wind_data$lat[valid_idx],\n      speed = wind_data$speed[valid_idx],\n      direction = wind_data$direction[valid_idx]\n    )\n    \n    # Remove any NA or invalid values\n    wind_df &lt;- wind_df[complete.cases(wind_df) & \n                      wind_df$speed &gt;= 0 & \n                      wind_df$speed &lt;

These routes were critically important as they represented the only road-based evacuation options for most residents. Analyzing these evacuation corridors in relation to fire and smoke conditions helps us understand the challenges faced during the evacuation.\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) provides a comprehensive source of road network data that is particularly valuable for remote regions like the Northwest Territories. As a collaborative mapping project, OSM relies on contributions from local knowledge, government data imports, and satellite imagery digitization. This crowdsourced approach often results in more up-to-date and detailed road networks than traditional commercial maps, especially in areas where official mapping resources may be limited. The OSM database includes not just road geometries, but also attributes like road classification, names, and reference numbers that help identify major evacuation routes.\nFor northern communities like Yellowknife, OSM’s road network data is crucial for emergency planning because it captures the limited transportation options available. The database accurately reflects the sparse road network characteristic of northern Canada, where communities are often connected by single highways that serve as critical lifelines during emergencies. Through the osmdata R package, we can programmatically access this road network data and focus our analysis on the key evacuation routes.\nFirst, let’s obtain the road network data using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and identify our key evacuation routes:\n\n# Transform plume buffer to WGS84 and get bbox for osm\nplume_buffer_wgs84 &lt;- sf::st_transform(plume_buffer, 4326)\nbbox_wgs84 &lt;- as.vector(sf::st_bbox(plume_buffer_wgs84))\n\n# Get main evacuation route (Highway 3)\nevac_route &lt;- osmdata::opq(bbox = bbox_wgs84) |&gt;\n  osmdata::add_osm_feature(\n    key = \"highway\", \n    value = c(\"primary\", \"trunk\", \"motorway\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  osmdata::osmdata_sf()\n\n:::\n\nOpenStreetMap Road Classifications\n\nmotorway: highest grade highways\ntrunk: major arterial routes\nprimary: major regional routes In the Northwest Territories, most intercity routes are classified as trunk or primary roads.\n\n:::\nNow we’ll filter for our specific evacuation routes:\n\n# Filter for both Highway 3 and Highway 1 segments\nevacuation_route &lt;- evac_route$osm_lines |&gt;\n  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(yk_boundary)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(\n    # Highway 3 segments\n    grepl(\"3\", ref, fixed = TRUE) | \n    grepl(\"Highway 3\", name, fixed = TRUE) |\n    grepl(\"Yellowknife Highway\", name, fixed = TRUE) |\n    # Highway 1 segments\n    grepl(\"1\", ref, fixed = TRUE) |\n    grepl(\"Highway 1\", name, fixed = TRUE) |\n    (name == \"Mackenzie Highway\" & highway == \"trunk\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(peak_data$data))\n\n# Transform evacuation routes if needed\nevacuation_route &lt;- evacuation_route |&gt;\n  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(peak_data$data))\n\n# Intersect routes to get those in the plume buffer\nlocal_routes &lt;- sf::st_intersection(evacuation_route, plume_goes)\n\nLet’s create a visualization of the evacuation routes in relation to our study area:\n\n# Create local routes visualization\np4_local &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() +\n  # Base map with routes\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = plume_buffer,\n                   fill = NA, color = \"gray70\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = local_routes,\n                   color = \"red\",\n                   linewidth = 1.5) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = sf::st_transform(yk_boundary, \n                                           sf::st_crs(peak_data$data)),\n                   fill = NA, color = \"#00BFFF\", linewidth = 0.75) +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Evacuation Routes from Yellowknife\",\n    subtitle = format(peak_data$datetime, \"%B %d, %Y %H:%M UTC\"),\n    caption = \"Red: Primary evacuation routes\\nLight blue: City boundary\\nGray dashed: 50km buffer\"\n  )\n\nprint(p4_local)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvacuation Route Considerations\nWhen analyzing evacuation routes, several factors are important: 1. Limited Options: In northern communities, there are often few alternate routes 2. Distance: Evacuees may need to travel long distances to reach safety 3. Vulnerability: Routes can be impacted by both fire and smoke 4. Capacity: Limited routes may face congestion during mass evacuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Check: Evacuation Routes\n\n\n\nWhy is OpenStreetMap particularly valuable for analyzing evacuation routes in remote regions like Northwest Territories?\n\nIt provides real-time traffic updates\nIt includes detailed elevation data\nIt offers more up-to-date and detailed road networks through crowdsourced local knowledge\nIt shows historical road conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Evacuation Conditions\nBy combining our analyses of smoke plumes, wind patterns, and evacuation routes, we can better understand the challenging conditions faced by evacuees and emergency managers. During wildfire evacuations, the interaction between smoke transport and evacuation routes is particularly critical - heavy smoke can reduce visibility, impact air quality, and potentially force evacuees to seek alternate routes.\nLet’s start by getting the most relevant FIRMS data for our peak smoke period:\n\n# Get FIRMS data for peak time with larger extent\nbbox &lt;- sf::st_bbox(sf::st_transform(plume_buffer, 4326)) |&gt;\n  round(4)\n\n\nfirms_url &lt;- sprintf(\n  \"https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/area/csv/%s/%s/%.4f,%.4f,%.4f,%.4f/%d/%s\",\n  \"API_MAP_KEY\",   # your MAP_KEY\n  \"VIIRS_NOAA20_SP\",                   # product (SOURCE)\n  bbox[\"xmin\"], bbox[\"ymin\"],         # WEST, SOUTH\n  bbox[\"xmax\"], bbox[\"ymax\"],         # EAST, NORTH\n  10,                                   # DAY_RANGE\n  format(peak_time$datetime, \"%Y-%m-%d\")  # DATE\n)\n\n# Get the data\nresp &lt;- httr2::request(firms_url) |&gt;\n  httr2::req_perform()\n\n# Process into spatial data\nfirms_points_peak &lt;- httr2::resp_body_string(resp) |&gt;\n  textConnection() |&gt;\n  utils::read.csv() |&gt;\n  sf::st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    crs = 4326\n  ) |&gt;\n  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(peak_data$data))\n\nNow we’ll create fire perimeters to show the extent of active burning:\n\n# Create fire perimeters using our earlier clustering function\nfire_perims &lt;- create_clustered_perimeters(firms_points_peak, \n                                          date = as.Date(peak_time$datetime))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Integrated Visualization\n\n\n\nThe following visualization combines several key elements: - Smoke plume extent (AOD values) - Active fire perimeters - Wind vectors showing transport patterns - Primary evacuation routes\nThis integration helps visualize the multiple hazards evacuees faced.\n\n\nNow we can create our comprehensive visualization showing the interaction of all these factors:\n\n# Create integrated visualization with larger extent\np4_integrated &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() +\n  # Smoke plume base\n  stars::geom_stars(data = peak_data$data, alpha = 0.50) +\n  # Evacuation routes\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = evacuation_route,\n                   color = \"black\",\n                   linewidth = 1.1) +\n  # Boundaries\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = sf::st_transform(yk_boundary, \n                                           sf::st_crs(peak_data$data)),\n                   fill = NA, color = \"#00BFFF\", linewidth = 2) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = sf::st_transform(plume_buffer, \n                                           sf::st_crs(peak_data$data)),\n                   fill = NA, color = \"grey50\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  # Fire perimeters\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = fire_perims,\n                   fill = \"orange\",\n                   alpha = 0.75,\n                   color = \"red\",\n                   linewidth = 0.5) +\n  # Wind vectors\n  ggplot2::geom_segment(data = wind_df,\n                        ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y,\n                                     xend = x + u*2500,\n                                     yend = y + v*2500,\n                                     color = speed),\n                        arrow = grid::arrow(length = ggplot2::unit(0.2, \"cm\")),\n                        alpha = 0.65,\n                        linewidth = 1.1) +\n  # Scales\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"AOD (Plume Hazard)\",\n    na.value = NA,\n    option = \"inferno\",\n    limits = c(0, 3)\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::scale_color_gradientn(\n    name = \"Wind Speed (m/s)\",\n    colors = c(\"blue\", \"purple\")\n  )+\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Yellowknife, CA Wildfire Crisis: Evacuation Conditions\",\n    subtitle = format(peak_data$datetime, \"%B %d, %Y %H:%M UTC\"),\n    caption = paste(\n      \"Black: Primary evacuation routes (OpenStreetMap) | Light blue: City boundary\\n\",\n      \"Orange areas: Active fire complexes (NASA FIRMS VIIRS 375m)\\n\",\n      \"Wind vectors: GOES-18 Derived Motion Winds | Background: GOES-18 Aerosol Optical Depth\\n\",\n      \"Gray dashed: 500km analysis extent\"\n    )\n  )+\n  ggplot2::coord_sf(xlim = sf::st_bbox(plume_goes)[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")],\n                    ylim = sf::st_bbox(plume_goes)[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")])\n\nprint(p4_integrated)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Evacuation Conditions\n\n\n\nWhen interpreting this integrated view, consider:\n\nRoute Vulnerability:\n\nProximity of fires to evacuation routes\nSmoke intensity along evacuation corridors\nWind patterns that could drive fire or smoke toward routes\n\nTemporal Factors:\n\nThis represents conditions at peak smoke intensity\nConditions likely varied throughout the evacuation period\nWind patterns influenced both fire spread and smoke transport\n\nSpatial Relationships:\n\nLimited evacuation options (single main route)\nRegional extent of smoke impacts\nPotential for route closures due to fire proximity\n\nEvacuation Management Implications:\n\nNeed for real-time monitoring of multiple hazards\nImportance of alternative evacuation plans\nValue of integrated spatial analysis for decision support\n\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive visualization demonstrates the complex challenges faced during the Yellowknife evacuation. The combination of active fires, extensive smoke plumes, and limited evacuation routes created a particularly challenging scenario for both emergency managers and evacuees. The wind patterns during this period were especially critical, as they influenced both the movement of smoke and the potential for fire spread toward evacuation routes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Check: Comprehensive Analysis\n\n\n\nWhich combination of data sources provides the most complete understanding of evacuation conditions during a wildfire event?\n\nFIRMS data and weather forecasts only\nWind patterns and smoke plumes only\nIntegration of fire detections, smoke plumes, wind patterns, and evacuation routes\nBurned area analysis only"

The increasing temperate of the planet due to the increased of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The gases trap heat in the atmosphere which leads to global warming and can affect the planet’s climate systems. Black Carbon is an air pollutant with bad health effects, and it can impact the environment. It can absorb the heat which can lead to the ice and snow to melt, also mention by APA(Environmental Protection Agency. (n.d.). Drivers of Climate Change in the Arctic. EPA.). Black carbon decreases the ability of snow and ice to reflect heat from the sun.\n\n\nIce Melting\nCurrently the Arctics sea ice has been showing a decrease and making the ice thinner and vulnerable. The ice is slowly going away as it ages and that can make the sea level rise. NSIDC ( National Snow and Ice data Center)gather data to provides an animation with sea ice animations for the arctic showing you how from 1979 to 2024 the Artic Sea ice is becoming smaller as time goes by. Not only the ice is melting over the years, but the sea levels are rising, and it is causing an effect on the habitat species like polar bears, seals, and walruses.\n\n\n\n\nArctic sea ice animations, 1979 to 2024\n\n\n\n\nSea Ice\nSea ice extent is the total area of the ocean’s surface that is covered by sea ice, and it has been declining at an alarming rate. Climate.gov provided a map and a graph to show us how the ice extent has been getting smaller over the years. The median extends from 1981-2010 compared to the median extent of 1991- 2020 was smaller and you can see the outline of the ice extent shrinking. The bottom graph displays the ice extend of each September from 1979-2024. From 1979 to 1998 you can see a small increase of the sea ice extent, but it starts to drop from 2000 to 2024. This shows how the ice keeps decreasing over time because the temperature of the Arctic keeps on increasing as time goes by.\n \n\n\nMy Example Using a Graph Bar:\nI create a graph bar to show an example of visual representation on how we are losing sea ice over the years. I wanted to show an example with the code that I made, to show how every year there is a change on how much sea ice we end up losing. Sometimes Arctic temperature data can be confusing, so providing an example can help break the information to clarify the data.\n\ndata = {\n    'Year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020],\n    'Sea Ice Loss': [1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.7, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1]  # Example loss values\n}\n\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Plotting the bar graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(df['Year'], df['Sea Ice Loss'], color='skyblue')\n\n# Adding labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Sea Ice Loss (Million Square Kilometers)')\nplt.title('Sea Ice Loss in the Arctic Over Time')\nplt.xticks(df['Year'], rotation=45)\n\n# Display \nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Explanation of the Content:\nThis passage describes the conditions and factors contributing to a wildfire in Los Angeles County in January 2025, including:\n\nMeteorological conditions: High winds (Santa Ana winds) and dry weather made the region highly susceptible to fire.\n\nVegetation buildup: Due to the wet years of 2022-2024, vegetation in the hills and foothills of California built up significantly, providing ample fuel for the fire.\n\nHydroclimate whiplash: A rapid transition from wet to dry conditions (hydroclimate whiplash) contributed to the fire risk by creating an environment where vegetation grew abundantly but was later dried out.\n\nSatellite data (NDVI): The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which uses satellite imagery from Landsat, shows that vegetation in the area was 30% greener than average. This indicates that a large amount of fuel (plants) was available to burn.\n\nSoil moisture: Despite the vegetation growth from the wet years, the soil moisture was extremely low (in the bottom 2% historically) by January 7, 2025. Low soil moisture is often associated with dry conditions that contribute to more intense fires.\n\n\nAir Quality in California Before and After Recent Wildfires\n-The January 2025 wildfires in California, particularly around Los Angeles, had a profound impact on air quality, with significant variations observed before, during, and after the events.\n\n\nBefore\nPrior to the wildfires, air quality in the greater Los Angeles region was generally within acceptable standards. Measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) typically remained below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) safety threshold of 35 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³), indicating healthy air conditions.\n\n\nDuring\nThe onset of the wildfires on January 7, 2025, led to a rapid and severe deterioration in air quality:\nPM2.5 Levels: Monitoring stations recorded alarming spikes in PM2.5 concentrations. For instance, the Harrison Elementary School station reported levels reaching 184.1 µg/m³, approximately 36.8 times the World Health Organization’s annual guideline value. Other stations across Los Angeles County registered one-hour peaks as high as 483.7 µg/m³, categorizing the air quality as hazardous.\nHealth Advisories: Authorities issued warnings urging residents, especially those with respiratory conditions, to remain indoors, utilize air purifiers, and wear N95 masks when necessary. Symptoms such as burning eyes, throat irritation, and exacerbated respiratory issues were commonly reported.\n\n\nAfter\nFollowing the containment of the fires, air quality began to improve; however, certain concerns persisted:\nResidual Pollution: While PM2.5 levels gradually declined to safer ranges, some areas continued to experience elevated concentrations due to lingering smoke and resuspended ash particles. Residents were advised to continue monitoring air quality reports and take precautions during outdoor activities.\nSoil and Water Contamination: The combustion of urban structures released hazardous substances, including heavy metals like lead and zinc, into the environment. These contaminants posed risks of soil and water pollution, necessitating ongoing environmental assessments and remediation efforts.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n\n# Air Quality Data Visualization\n\ndays = np.array([\"Before (Jan 1-6)\", \"During (Jan 7-12)\", \"After (Jan 13-18)\"])\npm25_levels = np.array([12, 184, 45])  # values in µg/m³\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.bar(days, pm25_levels, color=[\"green\", \"red\", \"orange\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Time Period\")\nplt.ylabel(\"PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)\")\nplt.title(\"Air Quality Before, During, and After the 2025 California Wildfires\")\nplt.ylim(0, 200)\nplt.show()"

    "text": "During the Wildfire (Jan 7-12) – Hazardous Air Quality\n\nPM2.5 Level: 184 µg/m³ (red bar)\nA dramatic spike in air pollution due to massive smoke, ash, and airborne particles.\n\n\nHealth Impacts:\nSevere health risks for everyone, not just sensitive groups. Increased respiratory issues, eye irritation, throat discomfort, and aggravated heart conditions. Authorities issued health warnings, urging people to stay indoors, wear N95 masks, and use air purifiers.\n\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nSmoke spread across cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, causing poor visibility. Nearby vegetation and wildlife suffered from the intense particulate matter."
